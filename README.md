# get_n_clean_data

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course project

This repository contains three files
* README.md: this document
* CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed
* run_analysis.R: Script used to analyze the data
 
The script does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
